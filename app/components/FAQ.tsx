      id: 'faq2',
      question: "What programming languages are best for AI development?",
      answer: "Popular programming languages for AI development include Python, R, Java, and Julia. Python is widely preferred due to its extensive libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn."
    },
    {
      id: 'faq3',
      question: "What is machine learning, and how is it different from AI?",
      answer: "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. AI is a broader concept that includes ML and other techniques."
    },
    {
      id: 'faq4',
      question: "How can I get started with software development for AI?",
      answer: "To get started, learn programming languages like Python, understand data structures and algorithms, and explore AI frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Online courses, tutorials, and projects are excellent resources for beginners."
